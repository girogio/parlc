\section{Code Generation}

The final step in the compilation process is the code generation phase. In this phase, the compiler takes the AST and generates the \code{PArIR} code that will be executed by the \code{PArDis} displays. The code generation phase is implemented in the \code{codegen} module, which is defined in the \code{src/codegen.rs} file.
